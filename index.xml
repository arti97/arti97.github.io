      <description>My sister joins college this year, with absolutely no development experience. And as she starts working on small projects, in technologies she&amp;rsquo;s never used before, there are times I see her being blocked by a seemingly impenetrable coding problem.
And more often than not, &amp;lsquo;how to proceed from here&amp;rsquo; is often rendered as a huge question mark across her face.

Given enough time, anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Arathi!
I like building stuff - and Iâ€™m lucky that I get to do it as my job. I currently work as a fullstack developer at Goldman Sachs helping in compliant reporting using (mostly) Java and React. Over the course of my 2 year professional stint, I&amp;rsquo;ve developed an interest in distributed systems - their workings, reliability, scalability - after all, it is the peripherals that matter.
Apart from this, I enjoy swimming, reading, trekking, marathons and sudoku.</description>
